## Traveling 旅行
```
I want to travel this winter.
Where would you like to go?
I'm still thinking about that. Do you know any good places? (我开始在思考这个，你有啥推荐的地方么？)
What would you like to do when you travel? (你旅行的时候想做些啥呢？)
I would like to go swimming. I would also like to eat some good food.
What kind of food would you like to eat?
I would like to eat healthy food. I prefer fresh fish.
How about Thailand? There are beautiful beaches there, and Thailand is famous for fresh fish.
Sounds great! Thanks!
