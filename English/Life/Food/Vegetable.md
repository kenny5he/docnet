Sure, but what is an Avocado?  Avocado are one of the most popular fruits now.
Some people call them 'alligator pears' (鳄梨).
What makes avocados so popular?
Avocados have lots of good oils and fats.
They are good for your health.

How do you make the salad?
We start by cutting some fresh tomatoes. (我们先切点西红柿)
Then we are going to cut up one whole cucumber. (然后我们再切(Whole: 整个)一整根黄瓜)
Now we take off the skin of an avocado and cut it.
